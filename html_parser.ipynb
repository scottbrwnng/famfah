The COM is responsible for the security of his or\nher Mission and, subject to the same exceptions noted above and an additional\nexception for any personnel for whom the Secretary of State has delegated\noperational control of overseas security functions to the head of such\npersonnel's parent agency (see\n    \n     2 FAH-2 H-116)\n    \n    , all U.S. Government personnel on\nofficial duty abroad and their authorized accompanying dependents.  The\nPresident's Letter of Instruction to Chiefs of Mission is the legal authority establishing\nCOM security responsibility.  This is a separate and distinct responsibility\nfrom COM authority.\n    \n \n    c.  COM authority and security responsibility are\nsubject to exceptions and exclusions by U.S. law or Presidential directive.  The\ngeneral exceptions are cited above.  These exceptions will apply throughout\n    \n     1 FAM 013.2\n    \n    , unless otherwise stated.\n    \n \n    d. Exclusions relate to personnel who are outside the\nboundaries of the qualifying language.  For example, the President's Letter of\nInstruction specifies that the COM's authority extends to all executive branch\npersonnel.  The use of the word \"personnel\" is meant to exclude those\nwho do not have a direct employer-employee relationship with the U.S.\nGovernment, e.g., Independent Contractors.\n    \n \n    e. The President’s Letter of Instruction is a\nfoundational document that explicitly addresses the authority and\nresponsibility of the COM and outlines the roles and responsibilities of\nexecutive branch agencies conducting official U.S. Government activities in the\nCOM’s country of responsibility.  The President instructs the COM to:\n    \n \n    (1)  Direct, coordinate, and supervise all U.S.\nGovernment executive branch activities, operations, and personnel;\n    \n \n    (2)  Take full responsibility for the security of the\nmission and all the personnel for whom the COM is responsible, regardless of\nlocation.  With the exceptions listed in section (a) and (b), the COM must\nprovide for the security of all U.S. Government personnel on official duty\nabroad and their authorized accompanying dependents; and\n    \n \n    (3)  Continually consult and coordinate with the GCC to\nkeep each other fully and currently informed, and to routinely coordinate on\nall activities of mutual interest.\n    \n \n    f.  The President's Letter additionally requires all\nU.S. Government personnel other than those under the command of a GCC to obtain\ncountry clearance before entering the COM's assigned country (or area of\nresponsibility) on official business. The COM may refuse country clearance or\nmay place conditions or restrictions on visiting personnel as deemed necessary.\n    \n \n    g.

Bureaus and some other specified Department\norganizations, usually headed by Assistant Secretaries or positions\nadministratively equivalent to the rank of Assistant Secretary, administer one\nor more major functions of the Department:\n    \n \n    (1)  If the bureau has more than one major function and\nis an organization of substantial size and or complexity, it should be further\nstructured to have deputy assistant secretaries (DASs), or positions ranked\nequivalent thereto, to oversee these major functions.  Where the size and scope\nof a major function requires it, a managing director may oversee collections of\noffice-level sub-functions.  A managing director is never equivalent to deputy\nassistant secretary rank.  Managing directors only report directly to deputy\nassistant secretaries, and directorate structure is such that managing\ndirectors are to have clearly defined managerial responsibilities (they are not\ndeputies to deputy assistant secretaries).\n    \n \n    (2)  Assistant Secretaries and equivalents report\norganizationally to their respective Under Secretary.  All Assistant\nSecretaries and equivalents have the right to direct access to the Secretary of\nState should circumstances arise where the Assistant Secretary believes it is\nurgent and direct access is required.  Assistant Secretaries should communicate\nwith the Secretary on non-urgent matters via Notes, Information Memos, etc.\n    \n \n    c.  Offices are structures below the DASs and are\nconstructed around sub-functions that require application of discrete bodies of\nknowledge and the exercise of policy control within that field.  These\nstructures usually are responsible for a complete functional field and are\nstaffed with professionals or specialists who are considered to be authorities\nin this field.\n    \n \n    d. Within the office structure there may be divisions\nthat are tasked with performing contiguous processes or perform staff or\noperating activities or carry out major sub-elements of the general functional\nfield.\n    \n \n    e. Branches and sections are further subdivisions of\nthe responsibilities assigned to a division.\n    \n \n    f.  Staff (as an organizational unit) is a structure\nconsisting of a minimum of six persons assigned to another organizational unit\nat any level.  Staff functions are generally discrete and self-contained.  A\nstaff may or may not have its own chief.\n   "

         "\n    a. For the reasons noted in\n    \n     1 FAM 014.5\n    \n    , paragraph a,\norganizational layering is to be kept to a minimum.  If an organization does\nestablish a substructure, that substructure must comprise at least two\nsubcomponents (e.g., no bureau may have just one office-level subcomponent; no\noffice may have just one division level subcomponent, etc.).  Routine functions\n(such as certain administrative activities) may be further subdivided into\nbranch and section levels.  See\n    \n     1 FAM 014.4\n    \n\n\n    for\nan explanation of the organizational structure layers and nomenclature.  A\nDeputy Assistant Secretary (DAS) is an organizational head, which has no\nnomenclature for its level, even though there can be multiple directorates or\noffices reporting to the DAS.\n    \n \n    b. Regional bureaus may be organized on sub regional,\nmultiple country, and/or individual country bases.  This structure is designed\nto be flexible and contemplates the regrouping of countries whenever workload,\ncrises, or other operational matters dictate.  These organizational components\nare equivalent to an office.\n    \n \n    c.  Organizational structures involving full deputy or\nassistant positions are to be minimized and are reserved for situations where\nthe volume and nature of the principal’s work cannot be effectively\naccomplished by one person.  In particular:\n    \n \n    (1)  A deputy or assistant is expected to participate\nwith the principal in carrying out the full range of management\nresponsibilities, and to act with full authority over the total work of the\norganization during the principal’s unavailability or absence.  Where the\nsupervision of an office needs to be subdivided, the appropriate subcomponents\nare divisions led by division chiefs.  The use of specialized deputies (usually\nmultiple in numbers) to oversee specific aspects of the organization (e.g.,\nDeputy for Policy or Deputy for Operations) is considered an exception to this\npolicy and will rarely be justified;\n    \n \n    (2)  Deputy positions may not be authorized with\nrespect to Under Secretaries, deputy assistant secretaries or equivalents,\nmanaging directors, division chiefs, branch chiefs, section chiefs, or staff\nchiefs; and\n    \n \n    (3)  The classification approval required for the\nestablishment of full deputy/assistant positions is vested in the director and\nthe appropriate HR Service Provider; all requests to classify full\ndeputy/assistant positions will be reviewed against criteria issued by\n    \n     GTM/OTA\n    \n    (use Form DS-3051, Checklist for\nRequesting Establishment of Deputy/Assistant Positions).\n    \n \n    d. To maintain effective and efficient span of control,\nthe following criteria will guide the design of the organizational structure:\n    \n \n    (1)  An office must have at least 12\nfull-time/part-time permanent positions;\n    \n \n    (2)  Any organizational entity or subcomponent (i.e.,\ndivision, branch, or section) requires a minimum of eight full-time/part-time\npermanent positions; except for staff units which require a minimum of six\nfull-time/part-time permanent positions;\n    \n \n    (3)  Subdividing an organization must result in the\nsmallest possible number of subcomponents consistent with the criteria listed\nherein and with the requirements of the organization’s functional\nmission; and\n    \n \n    (4)  If an office is subdivided, the total number of\nfull-time/part-time permanent positions in the office (including\ndivisions/branches/sections) must be at least 17, eight for two divisions plus\nthe office director.  If the organization drops below the appropriate number of\npositions for a period exceeding 6 months, consideration should be given to its\nabolishment and/or consolidation into some other existing unit.\n    \n \n    e. Because the Department’s fundamental\norganizational building block is the office, the following guidelines should be\nconsidered carefully in creating an office:\n    \n \n    (1)  Like functions should be grouped together in an\norganization;\n    \n \n    (2)  Integral policy or operational fields should not\nbe divided into separate offices; and\n    \n \n    (3)  The level and degree of policy and negotiating\nresponsibility exercised by the organization are important factors in\ndetermining the need for an office.\n   "

A statutory authority must be delegated in writing\nby the official with that authority in order for the delegation to be\neffective.  A functional statement of authority that is not statutory, approved\nby the Under Secretary for Management constitutes an official delegation of\nauthority for the Department.  Authority vested in an individual position\nbecomes a part of the authority of each position in the direct line of\nsupervision above that position, except where authority is specifically vested\nby law in a designated official.  Once the Under Secretary for Management has\ndelegated authority over a topic to a bureau, the bureau heads may re-delegate\nthat authority within their bureau if the Under Secretary has specifically\ngranted re-delegation authority.\n    \n \n    c.  Bureaus or offices are responsible for submitting\nupdated functional statements to the Office of Directives Management\n(A/GIS/DIR), whenever necessary, to ensure that 1 FAM, Organization and\nFunctions, is current at all times.  Bureaus or offices are also responsible\nfor providing copies of updated functional statements and organization charts\nto the appropriate HR Service Provider and\n    \n     GTM/OTA\n    \n    to facilitate their classification and position-management\nresponsibilities.\n   "

After CGFS/FPRA/FP approves the request, it updates\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    and notifies the appropriate systems and CGFS personnel, the requesting\nbureau, other bureau personnel, as needed, and A/GIS/DIR that changes to the\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    have been made.  CGFS/FPRA/FP will also provide updates to\nIRM/OPS/SIO/EPI/DM to record changes in the MRD to reflect the new and revised\ntitles, symbols, and/or codes.  Application systems that require real-time\nnotifications of changes in titles, symbols, and/or codes may receive these updates\ndirectly from the MRD in the future.  CGFS/FPRA/FP will consolidate its updates\nto\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    and send them to A/GIS/DIR with a change transmittal for publication\non the Office of Directives Management intranet site.\n    \n \n    f.  Bureaus will use the CGFS/FPRA/FP\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    update to\nfinalize their\n    \n     1 FAM functions\n    \n    and responsibilities statements as soon as\npossible following the publication of the updated\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    .\n   "

         "\n    a. Under the direction of the President and Secretary\nof State, the Chief of Mission (COM) has full responsibility for the direction,\ncoordination, and supervision of all U.S. executive branch employees in his or\nher country (or, in the case of Chiefs of Mission who do not represent the\nUnited States to another country, his or her area of responsibility),\nregardless of their employment categories or location, except those under the\ncommand of a  Geographic Combatant Commander (GCC), individuals officially on\nthe staff of an International Organization (IO) and performing the functions of\nthat organization, or Voice of America correspondents on official assignment.  With\nthese exceptions, the COM is in charge of all executive branch personnel,\nactivities, and operations in his or her country of assignment (or area of\nresponsibility).\n    \n \n    b. The COM is responsible for the security of his or\nher Mission and, subject to the same exceptions noted above and an additional\nexception for any personnel for whom the Secretary of State has delegated\noperational control of overseas security functions to the head of such\npersonnel's parent agency (see\n    \n     2 FAH-2 H-116)\n    \n    , all U.S. Government personnel on\nofficial duty abroad and their authorized accompanying dependents.  The\nPresident's Letter of Instruction to Chiefs of Mission is the legal authority establishing\nCOM security responsibility.  This is a separate and distinct responsibility\nfrom COM authority.\n    \n \n    c.  COM authority and security responsibility are\nsubject to exceptions and exclusions by U.S. law or Presidential directive.  The\ngeneral exceptions are cited above.  These exceptions will apply throughout\n    \n     1 FAM 013.2\n    \n    , unless otherwise stated.\n    \n \n    d. Exclusions relate to personnel who are outside the\nboundaries of the qualifying language.  For example, the President's Letter of\nInstruction specifies that the COM's authority extends to all executive branch\npersonnel.  The use of the word \"personnel\" is meant to exclude those\nwho do not have a direct employer-employee relationship with the U.S.\nGovernment, e.g., Independent Contractors.\n    \n \n    e. The President’s Letter of Instruction is a\nfoundational document that explicitly addresses the authority and\nresponsibility of the COM and outlines the roles and responsibilities of\nexecutive branch agencies conducting official U.S. Government activities in the\nCOM’s country of responsibility.  The President instructs the COM to:\n    \n \n    (1)  Direct, coordinate, and supervise all U.S.\nGovernment executive branch activities, operations, and personnel;\n    \n \n    (2)  Take full responsibility for the security of the\nmission and all the personnel for whom the COM is responsible, regardless of\nlocation.  With the exceptions listed in section (a) and (b), the COM must\nprovide for the security of all U.S. Government personnel on official duty\nabroad and their authorized accompanying dependents; and\n    \n \n    (3)  Continually consult and coordinate with the GCC to\nkeep each other fully and currently informed, and to routinely coordinate on\nall activities of mutual interest.\n    \n \n    f.  The President's Letter additionally requires all\nU.S. Government personnel other than those under the command of a GCC to obtain\ncountry clearance before entering the COM's assigned country (or area of\nresponsibility) on official business. The COM may refuse country clearance or\nmay place conditions or restrictions on visiting personnel as deemed necessary.\n    \n \n    g. All executive branch agencies under COM authority\nmust submit staffing change requests in accordance with NSDD 38 to obtain COM\napproval before changing the size, composition, or mandate of their staffs,\nregardless of the duration or purpose of the proposed position or assignment\n(see\n    \n     2 FAH-2 H-113.1).\n    \n \n \n    h. All executive branch agencies under COM authority\nmust submit requests to the COM to abolish positions that have remained vacant\nfor at least two years through the NSDD 38 process.\n    \n \n    i.  The contents of each President's Letter of\nInstruction may differ according to, for example, whether the COM has a\nbilateral or international organization portfolio.\n    \n \n    j.  In accordance with 22 U.S.C. 3927a, COMs are\nrequired to undertake a review of programs, personnel, and funding levels of\nevery staff element under their authority at least once every 5 years to better\nmeet foreign policy goals and ensure capital projects are sized correctly.  This\nrightsizing mandate extends to overseas staff of all executive branch agencies\nunder COM authority.\n    \n \n    k. Additional legislation, Presidential directives, and\nexecutive orders relating to the responsibilities of the COM (including\nsecurity responsibility) and the exercise of COM authority over U.S. Government\nexecutive branch personnel, operations, and activities overseas include, but\nare not limited to, the following:\n    \n \n    (1)  22 U.S.C. 3902(3), Definitions of “Chief of\nMission”:\n    \n \n    (a)  Chief of Mission means the principal officer in\ncharge of a diplomatic mission of the United States or of a United States\noffice abroad which is designated by the Secretary of State as diplomatic in\nnature, including certain officers designated as charge d’affaires.\n    \n \n    (b)  The principal officers in charge of certain\nConsulates General have been designated as COMs (for example, the Consulate\nGeneral in Hong Kong).\n    \n \n    (2)  22 U.S.C. 4805, which states that Federal\nagencies, with or without reimbursement, shall cooperate (through agreements)\nto the maximum extent possible with the Secretary of State to perform security\ninspections, provide logistical support relating to the differing missions and\nfacilities of other federal agencies, and perform other overseas security\nfunctions as may be authorized by the Secretary.\n    \n \n    (3)  22 U.S.C. 4831, Accountability Review Board\n– provides the requirement for when the Secretary of State shall convene\nan Accountability Review Board (ARB).  Specifically, a Board must be convened\nif there is an incident resulting in loss of life, serious injury, or\nsignificant destruction of property at or related to a U.S. Government mission\nabroad, or if there is a serious breach of security involving the intelligence\nactivities of a foreign government directed at a U.S. Government mission abroad,\nand the incident does not clearly involve only causes unrelated to security.\n    \n     12 FAM 030\n    \n\n\n    provides further information.\n    \n \n    (4)  22 U.S.C. 3927(c) provides that each COM to a\nforeign country shall have as a principal duty the promotion of United States\ngoods and services for export to such country.  More information can be found\nin the Foreign Service Act.\n    \n \n    (5)  Pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 4802, the Secretary of State\nis responsible for the following.  COMs may be required to implement such\npolicies on the Secretary's behalf:\n    \n \n    (a)  Coordinating all U.S. Government personnel assigned\nto diplomatic or consular posts or other U.S. missions abroad pursuant to U.S. Government\nauthorization, except for facilities, installations, or personnel under the\ncommand of a GCC;\n    \n \n    (b)  Establishing appropriate overseas staffing levels\nfor all such posts and missions for all federal agencies with activities abroad\nexcept for personnel and activities under the command of a GCC or regional\ninspector general offices under the jurisdiction of the Inspector General, U.S.\nAgency for International Development (USAID); and\n    \n \n    (c)  Developing and implementing policies and programs\nthat provide for the safe and efficient evacuation of U.S. Government\npersonnel, dependents, and private U.S. citizens when their lives are\nendangered.\n    \n \n    (6)  The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Arms\nExport Control Act, and other statutes authorize a range of programs for\nforeign assistance and Foreign Military Sales.  The COM has a significant role\nin directing and supervising the implementation of all programs authorized by\nthese Acts in the COM's country of responsibility, consistent with the\nPresident's Letter of Instruction.\n    \n \n    (7)  National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 38,\nJuly 13, 1982, on staffing at Diplomatic Missions and Constituent Posts.  NSDD\n38 and guidelines allow for the flexible, systematic and expeditious deployment\nand management of personnel of all U.S. Government agencies operating under the\nauthority of the COM in support of U.S. foreign policy objectives.  The\ndirective requires executive branch departments and agencies obtain COM\napproval prior to undertaking changes to current staffing authorizations.  In\naddition, the directive serves as the foundational document for establishing\nappropriate overseas staffing levels at posts and missions for federal agencies\nwith activities abroad (excluding exceptions).  The point of contact in the\nState Department for such matters is the Office of Management Strategy &\nSolutions (M/SS).  The Department of State maintains a current record of\nstaffing authorization for each overseas post.  See\n    \n     2 FAH-2 H-110\n    \n    for further\ninformation.\n    \n \n    (8)  E.O. 12333, United States Intelligence Activities,\nPart 1.9[1], states that the Secretary of State shall: (a) Overtly collect\ninformation relevant to United States foreign policy concerns; (b) Produce and\ndisseminate foreign intelligence relating to United States foreign policy as\nrequired for the execution of the Secretary's responsibilities; (c)\nDisseminate, as appropriate, reports received from United States diplomatic and\nconsular posts; (d) Transmit reporting requirements of the Intelligence Community\nto the Chiefs of United States Missions abroad; and (e) Support Chiefs of\nMissions in discharging their statutory responsibilities for direction and\ncoordination of mission activities.\n    \n \n    (9)  Relationship with Non-Personal Services Commercial\nContractors, see\n    \n     2 FAH-2 H-116.6\n    \n    and, if appropriate, Federal Acquisition\nRegulation (FAR) 52.225-19.\n    \n \n    l.\n    \n     2 FAM 111.3\n    \n    ,\n    \n     2 FAM 113\n    \n    and\n    \n     2 FAH-2 H-100\n    \n    contain\nmore information on COM authorities and responsibilities.  Not all agencies may\nbe able to access the Department of State website.\n   "

         "\n    a. The Department is headed by the Secretary who\npromulgates such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the\nfunctions vested by statute or executive order in the Department.  The\nSecretary may delegate authority to perform any of these functions including,\nif so specified, the authority to redelegate any of the functions to officers\nand employees under the Secretary’s direction and supervision (22 U.S.C.\n2651a):\n    \n \n    (1)  The Deputy Secretary serves as the Acting\nSecretary should the Secretary die, resign, or otherwise become unable to\nperform the functions and duties of the office. Both Deputy Secretaries serve\nas principal advisers to the Secretary in the formulation and conduct of all\nU.S. foreign policy and assists\n    \n\n    the\nSecretary in providing overall supervision and direction to all substantive and\nadministrative elements of the Department.\n    \n \n    (2)  Under Secretaries assist the Secretary and Deputy\nSecretaries in the formulation and conduct of U.S. foreign policy and provide\nspecific leadership in matters such as:\n    \n \n    (a)  Interdepartmental activities of the U.S. government\nabroad;\n    \n \n    (b)  Intergovernmental affairs;\n    \n \n    (c)  Foreign economic and commercial policy;\n    \n \n    (d)  Security assistance programs;\n    \n \n    (e)  Global human rights, crime, science, and environment\nprograms; and\n    \n \n    (f)   Administrative operations of the Department\n    \n \n    (3)  Ambassadors at Large are appointed by the\nPresident and serve anywhere in the world to help with emergent problems, to\nconduct special or intensive negotiations, or serve in other capacities, as\nrequested by the Secretary or the President.\n    \n \n    (4)  The Under Secretaries have administrative and\nmanagement oversight over the Department's Assistant Secretaries and Assistant\nSecretary equivalents under their respective under secretariats.\n    \n \n    b. Bureaus and some other specified Department\norganizations, usually headed by Assistant Secretaries or positions\nadministratively equivalent to the rank of Assistant Secretary, administer one\nor more major functions of the Department:\n    \n \n    (1)  If the bureau has more than one major function and\nis an organization of substantial size and or complexity, it should be further\nstructured to have deputy assistant secretaries (DASs), or positions ranked\nequivalent thereto, to oversee these major functions.  Where the size and scope\nof a major function requires it, a managing director may oversee collections of\noffice-level sub-functions.  A managing director is never equivalent to deputy\nassistant secretary rank.  Managing directors only report directly to deputy\nassistant secretaries, and directorate structure is such that managing\ndirectors are to have clearly defined managerial responsibilities (they are not\ndeputies to deputy assistant secretaries).\n    \n \n    (2)  Assistant Secretaries and equivalents report\norganizationally to their respective Under Secretary.  All Assistant\nSecretaries and equivalents have the right to direct access to the Secretary of\nState should circumstances arise where the Assistant Secretary believes it is\nurgent and direct access is required.  Assistant Secretaries should communicate\nwith the Secretary on non-urgent matters via Notes, Information Memos, etc.\n    \n \n    c.  Offices are structures below the DASs and are\nconstructed around sub-functions that require application of discrete bodies of\nknowledge and the exercise of policy control within that field.  These\nstructures usually are responsible for a complete functional field and are\nstaffed with professionals or specialists who are considered to be authorities\nin this field.\n    \n \n    d. Within the office structure there may be divisions\nthat are tasked with performing contiguous processes or perform staff or\noperating activities or carry out major sub-elements of the general functional\nfield.\n    \n \n    e. Branches and sections are further subdivisions of\nthe responsibilities assigned to a division.\n    \n \n    f.  Staff (as an organizational unit) is a structure\nconsisting of a minimum of six persons assigned to another organizational unit\nat any level.  Staff functions are generally discrete and self-contained.  A\nstaff may or may not have its own chief.\n   "

Organizational layers should be limited to the\nminimum number consistent with effective span of control and performance of\nmission.  The addition of nonessential supervisory layers increases problems\nassociated with establishing clear delegation of responsibility and authority,\ntransmission of information, work flow, clearances, operational costs, and\nmorale.\n    \n \n    b. Full deputy or assistant positions are normally\nappropriate only at higher levels within the organization.  Proliferation of\ndeputy positions is a major source of poor organizational design and position\nmanagement.\n    \n \n    c.  Staff units that report directly to an Assistant\nSecretary should be established only to provide direct support in the\ndevelopment of policy or planning or to provide a point for coordination of\ncross-cutting activities.\n    \n \n    d. Span of control is the number of subordinates one\nsupervisor can effectively manage.  It is a significant aspect of\norganizational design.  A narrow span of control leads to unnecessary\norganizational layering or proliferation; frequently results in excessive\ncontrol on the part of supervisors; and stifles initiative among subordinates\n(particularly in policy development or support activities).  On the other hand,\ntoo wide a span of control hinders the ability to make supervisory decisions\nbased on a thorough knowledge and understanding of the particular issue.\n   "

         "\n    a. For the reasons noted in\n    \n     1 FAM 014.5\n    \n    , paragraph a,\norganizational layering is to be kept to a minimum.  If an organization does\nestablish a substructure, that substructure must comprise at least two\nsubcomponents (e.g., no bureau may have just one office-level subcomponent; no\noffice may have just one division level subcomponent, etc.).  Routine functions\n(such as certain administrative activities) may be further subdivided into\nbranch and section levels.  See\n    \n     1 FAM 014.4\n    \n\n\n    for\nan explanation of the organizational structure layers and nomenclature.  A\nDeputy Assistant Secretary (DAS) is an organizational head, which has no\nnomenclature for its level, even though there can be multiple directorates or\noffices reporting to the DAS.\n    \n \n    b. Regional bureaus may be organized on sub regional,\nmultiple country, and/or individual country bases.  This structure is designed\nto be flexible and contemplates the regrouping of countries whenever workload,\ncrises, or other operational matters dictate.  These organizational components\nare equivalent to an office.\n    \n \n    c.  Organizational structures involving full deputy or\nassistant positions are to be minimized and are reserved for situations where\nthe volume and nature of the principal’s work cannot be effectively\naccomplished by one person.  In particular:\n    \n \n    (1)  A deputy or assistant is expected to participate\nwith the principal in carrying out the full range of management\nresponsibilities, and to act with full authority over the total work of the\norganization during the principal’s unavailability or absence.  Where the\nsupervision of an office needs to be subdivided, the appropriate subcomponents\nare divisions led by division chiefs.  The use of specialized deputies (usually\nmultiple in numbers) to oversee specific aspects of the organization (e.g.,\nDeputy for Policy or Deputy for Operations) is considered an exception to this\npolicy and will rarely be justified;\n    \n \n    (2)  Deputy positions may not be authorized with\nrespect to Under Secretaries, deputy assistant secretaries or equivalents,\nmanaging directors, division chiefs, branch chiefs, section chiefs, or staff\nchiefs; and\n    \n \n    (3)  The classification approval required for the\nestablishment of full deputy/assistant positions is vested in the director and\nthe appropriate HR Service Provider; all requests to classify full\ndeputy/assistant positions will be reviewed against criteria issued by\n    \n     GTM/OTA\n    \n    (use Form DS-3051, Checklist for\nRequesting Establishment of Deputy/Assistant Positions).\n    \n \n    d. To maintain effective and efficient span of control,\nthe following criteria will guide the design of the organizational structure:\n    \n \n    (1)  An office must have at least 12\nfull-time/part-time permanent positions;\n    \n \n    (2)  Any organizational entity or subcomponent (i.e.,\ndivision, branch, or section) requires a minimum of eight full-time/part-time\npermanent positions; except for staff units which require a minimum of six\nfull-time/part-time permanent positions;\n    \n \n    (3)  Subdividing an organization must result in the\nsmallest possible number of subcomponents consistent with the criteria listed\nherein and with the requirements of the organization’s functional\nmission; and\n    \n \n    (4)  If an office is subdivided, the total number of\nfull-time/part-time permanent positions in the office (including\ndivisions/branches/sections) must be at least 17, eight for two divisions plus\nthe office director.  If the organization drops below the appropriate number of\npositions for a period exceeding 6 months, consideration should be given to its\nabolishment and/or consolidation into some other existing unit.\n    \n \n    e. Because the Department’s fundamental\norganizational building block is the office, the following guidelines should be\nconsidered carefully in creating an office:\n    \n \n    (1)  Like functions should be grouped together in an\norganization;\n    \n \n    (2)  Integral policy or operational fields should not\nbe divided into separate offices; and\n    \n \n    (3)  The level and degree of policy and negotiating\nresponsibility exercised by the organization are important factors in\ndetermining the need for an office.\n   "

A statutory authority must be delegated in writing\nby the official with that authority in order for the delegation to be\neffective.  A functional statement of authority that is not statutory, approved\nby the Under Secretary for Management constitutes an official delegation of\nauthority for the Department.  Authority vested in an individual position\nbecomes a part of the authority of each position in the direct line of\nsupervision above that position, except where authority is specifically vested\nby law in a designated official.  Once the Under Secretary for Management has\ndelegated authority over a topic to a bureau, the bureau heads may re-delegate\nthat authority within their bureau if the Under Secretary has specifically\ngranted re-delegation authority.\n    \n \n    c.  Bureaus or offices are responsible for submitting\nupdated functional statements to the Office of Directives Management\n(A/GIS/DIR), whenever necessary, to ensure that 1 FAM, Organization and\nFunctions, is current at all times.  Bureaus or offices are also responsible\nfor providing copies of updated functional statements and organization charts\nto the appropriate HR Service Provider and\n    \n     GTM/OTA\n    \n    to facilitate their classification and position-management\nresponsibilities.\n   "

         "\n    a. When changes in an organization and/or program are\napproved, the responsible office (usually the Executive Director) must send a\nwritten request with the\n    \n     Office of Organization\nand Talent Analytics\n    \n\n     (GTM/OTA\n    \n    )\norganizational structure design approval and head of bureau approvals for the\nestablishment, change, or discontinuation of organizations to CGFS/FPRA/FP in\naccordance with\n    \n     4 FAH-1 H-117\n    \n\n\n    Code\nMaintenance.  The request must include the approvals, an updated bureau\norganization chart, and the draft update to the\n    \n     1 FAM functions\n    \n    and\nresponsibilities statements.  The request with documentation must be sent via\nSMART record e-mail.\n    \n \n    b. When establishing or changing an organization name,\nrelated organization symbol and/or code, the responsible office may suggest\norganization symbols and codes.  Bureaus can refer to their existing codes in\n    \n     4 FAH-1 H-420\n    \n\n\n    to see the structure and to\nreview all their codes for other potential changes, such as organizations that\nhave been discontinued.\n    \n \n    c.  CGFS/FPRA/FP will review the request and work with\nthe bureau to ensure titles, symbols, and codes meet the requirements and will\nassign new and revised titles, symbols, and codes as required and discontinue\nany codes no longer required.\n    \n \n    d. Bureaus must also choose a pay period in which they\nwant these changes to become effective.  The date they choose is generally\nbased upon the completion date of Form SF-50, Notification of Personnel Action,\nfor the employees that are affected when an organization code is established,\nchanged, or discontinued.  Bureaus will have approximately three pay periods to\ncomplete personnel actions and work with other systems to transfer staff from\ncodes being discontinued.  This information (effective dates) will be recorded\nin the MRD.\n    \n \n    e. After CGFS/FPRA/FP approves the request, it updates\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    and notifies the appropriate systems and CGFS personnel, the requesting\nbureau, other bureau personnel, as needed, and A/GIS/DIR that changes to the\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    have been made.  CGFS/FPRA/FP will also provide updates to\nIRM/OPS/SIO/EPI/DM to record changes in the MRD to reflect the new and revised\ntitles, symbols, and/or codes.  Application systems that require real-time\nnotifications of changes in titles, symbols, and/or codes may receive these updates\ndirectly from the MRD in the future.  CGFS/FPRA/FP will consolidate its updates\nto\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    and send them to A/GIS/DIR with a change transmittal for publication\non the Office of Directives Management intranet site.\n    \n \n    f.  Bureaus will use the CGFS/FPRA/FP\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    update to\nfinalize their\n    \n     1 FAM functions\n    \n    and responsibilities statements as soon as\npossible following the publication of the updated\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    .\n   "

The COM may refuse country clearance or\nmay place conditions or restrictions on visiting personnel as deemed necessary.\n    \n \n    g.

The Department is headed by the Secretary who\npromulgates such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the\nfunctions vested by statute or executive order in the Department.  The\nSecretary may delegate authority to perform any of these functions including,\nif so specified, the authority to redelegate any of the functions to officers\nand employees under the Secretary’s direction and supervision (22 U.S.C.\n2651a):\n    \n \n    (1)  The Deputy Secretary serves as the Acting\nSecretary should the Secretary die, resign, or otherwise become unable to\nperform the functions and duties of the office. Both Deputy Secretaries serve\nas principal advisers to the Secretary in the formulation and conduct of all\nU.S. foreign policy and assists\n    \n\n    the\nSecretary in providing overall supervision and direction to all substantive and\nadministrative elements of the Department.\n    \n \n    (2)  Under Secretaries assist the Secretary and Deputy\nSecretaries in the formulation and conduct of U.S. foreign policy and provide\nspecific leadership in matters such as:\n    \n \n    (a)  Interdepartmental activities of the U.S. government\nabroad;\n    \n \n    (b)  Intergovernmental affairs;\n    \n \n    (c)  Foreign economic and commercial policy;\n    \n \n    (d)  Security assistance programs;\n    \n \n    (e)  Global human rights, crime, science, and environment\nprograms; and\n    \n \n    (f)   Administrative operations of the Department\n    \n \n    (3)  Ambassadors at Large are appointed by the\nPresident and serve anywhere in the world to help with emergent problems, to\nconduct special or intensive negotiations, or serve in other capacities, as\nrequested by the Secretary or the President.\n    \n \n    (4)  The Under Secretaries have administrative and\nmanagement oversight over the Department's Assistant Secretaries and Assistant\nSecretary equivalents under their respective under secretariats.\n    \n \n    b. Bureaus and some other specified Department\norganizations, usually headed by Assistant Secretaries or positions\nadministratively equivalent to the rank of Assistant Secretary, administer one\nor more major functions of the Department:\n    \n \n    (1)  If the bureau has more than one major function and\nis an organization of substantial size and or complexity, it should be further\nstructured to have deputy assistant secretaries (DASs), or positions ranked\nequivalent thereto, to oversee these major functions.  Where the size and scope\nof a major function requires it, a managing director may oversee collections of\noffice-level sub-functions.  A managing director is never equivalent to deputy\nassistant secretary rank.  Managing directors only report directly to deputy\nassistant secretaries, and directorate structure is such that managing\ndirectors are to have clearly defined managerial responsibilities (they are not\ndeputies to deputy assistant secretaries).\n    \n \n    (2)  Assistant Secretaries and equivalents report\norganizationally to their respective Under Secretary.  All Assistant\nSecretaries and equivalents have the right to direct access to the Secretary of\nState should circumstances arise where the Assistant Secretary believes it is\nurgent and direct access is required.  Assistant Secretaries should communicate\nwith the Secretary on non-urgent matters via Notes, Information Memos, etc.\n    \n \n    c.  Offices are structures below the DASs and are\nconstructed around sub-functions that require application of discrete bodies of\nknowledge and the exercise of policy control within that field.  These\nstructures usually are responsible for a complete functional field and are\nstaffed with professionals or specialists who are considered to be authorities\nin this field.\n    \n \n    d. Within the office structure there may be divisions\nthat are tasked with performing contiguous processes or perform staff or\noperating activities or carry out major sub-elements of the general functional\nfield.\n    \n \n    e. Branches and sections are further subdivisions of\nthe responsibilities assigned to a division.\n    \n \n    f.  Staff (as an organizational unit) is a structure\nconsisting of a minimum of six persons assigned to another organizational unit\nat any level.  Staff functions are generally discrete and self-contained.  A\nstaff may or may not have its own chief.\n   ",

For the reasons noted in\n    \n     1 FAM 014.5\n    \n    , paragraph a,\norganizational layering is to be kept to a minimum.  If an organization does\nestablish a substructure, that substructure must comprise at least two\nsubcomponents (e.g., no bureau may have just one office-level subcomponent; no\noffice may have just one division level subcomponent, etc.).  Routine functions\n(such as certain administrative activities) may be further subdivided into\nbranch and section levels.  See\n    \n     1 FAM 014.4\n    \n\n\n    for\nan explanation of the organizational structure layers and nomenclature.  A\nDeputy Assistant Secretary (DAS) is an organizational head, which has no\nnomenclature for its level, even though there can be multiple directorates or\noffices reporting to the DAS.\n    \n \n    b. Regional bureaus may be organized on sub regional,\nmultiple country, and/or individual country bases.  This structure is designed\nto be flexible and contemplates the regrouping of countries whenever workload,\ncrises, or other operational matters dictate.  These organizational components\nare equivalent to an office.\n    \n \n    c.  Organizational structures involving full deputy or\nassistant positions are to be minimized and are reserved for situations where\nthe volume and nature of the principal’s work cannot be effectively\naccomplished by one person.  In particular:\n    \n \n    (1)  A deputy or assistant is expected to participate\nwith the principal in carrying out the full range of management\nresponsibilities, and to act with full authority over the total work of the\norganization during the principal’s unavailability or absence.  Where the\nsupervision of an office needs to be subdivided, the appropriate subcomponents\nare divisions led by division chiefs.  The use of specialized deputies (usually\nmultiple in numbers) to oversee specific aspects of the organization (e.g.,\nDeputy for Policy or Deputy for Operations) is considered an exception to this\npolicy and will rarely be justified;\n    \n \n    (2)  Deputy positions may not be authorized with\nrespect to Under Secretaries, deputy assistant secretaries or equivalents,\nmanaging directors, division chiefs, branch chiefs, section chiefs, or staff\nchiefs; and\n    \n \n    (3)  The classification approval required for the\nestablishment of full deputy/assistant positions is vested in the director and\nthe appropriate HR Service Provider; all requests to classify full\ndeputy/assistant positions will be reviewed against criteria issued by\n    \n     GTM/OTA\n    \n    (use Form DS-3051, Checklist for\nRequesting Establishment of Deputy/Assistant Positions).\n    \n \n    d. To maintain effective and efficient span of control,\nthe following criteria will guide the design of the organizational structure:\n    \n \n    (1)  An office must have at least 12\nfull-time/part-time permanent positions;\n    \n \n    (2)  Any organizational entity or subcomponent (i.e.,\ndivision, branch, or section) requires a minimum of eight full-time/part-time\npermanent positions; except for staff units which require a minimum of six\nfull-time/part-time permanent positions;\n    \n \n    (3)  Subdividing an organization must result in the\nsmallest possible number of subcomponents consistent with the criteria listed\nherein and with the requirements of the organization’s functional\nmission; and\n    \n \n    (4)  If an office is subdivided, the total number of\nfull-time/part-time permanent positions in the office (including\ndivisions/branches/sections) must be at least 17, eight for two divisions plus\nthe office director.  If the organization drops below the appropriate number of\npositions for a period exceeding 6 months, consideration should be given to its\nabolishment and/or consolidation into some other existing unit.\n    \n \n    e. Because the Department’s fundamental\norganizational building block is the office, the following guidelines should be\nconsidered carefully in creating an office:\n    \n \n    (1)  Like functions should be grouped together in an\norganization;\n    \n \n    (2)  Integral policy or operational fields should not\nbe divided into separate offices; and\n    \n \n    (3)  The level and degree of policy and negotiating\nresponsibility exercised by the organization are important factors in\ndetermining the need for an office.\n   ",

         "\n    a. Functional statements provide the minimum detail to\ndefine the area of responsibility of an organizational unit; to distinguish its\nactivities from those of related units; and to eliminate potential overlap and\nduplication.  To facilitate the classification of positions at all organization\nlevels, functional statements are required for all approved organizational\nstructures, even though such statements may not be published in the FAM.\n    \n \n    b. A statutory authority must be delegated in writing\nby the official with that authority in order for the delegation to be\neffective.  A functional statement of authority that is not statutory, approved\nby the Under Secretary for Management constitutes an official delegation of\nauthority for the Department.  Authority vested in an individual position\nbecomes a part of the authority of each position in the direct line of\nsupervision above that position, except where authority is specifically vested\nby law in a designated official.  Once the Under Secretary for Management has\ndelegated authority over a topic to a bureau, the bureau heads may re-delegate\nthat authority within their bureau if the Under Secretary has specifically\ngranted re-delegation authority.\n    \n \n    c.  Bureaus or offices are responsible for submitting\nupdated functional statements to the Office of Directives Management\n(A/GIS/DIR), whenever necessary, to ensure that 1 FAM, Organization and\nFunctions, is current at all times.  Bureaus or offices are also responsible\nfor providing copies of updated functional statements and organization charts\nto the appropriate HR Service Provider and\n    \n     GTM/OTA\n    \n    to facilitate their classification and position-management\nresponsibilities.\n   ",
