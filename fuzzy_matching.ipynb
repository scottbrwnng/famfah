         "\n    a. Under the direction of the President and Secretary\nof State, the Chief of Mission (COM) has full responsibility for the direction,\ncoordination, and supervision of all U.S. executive branch employees in his or\nher country (or, in the case of Chiefs of Mission who do not represent the\nUnited States to another country, his or her area of responsibility),\nregardless of their employment categories or location, except those under the\ncommand of a  Geographic Combatant Commander (GCC), individuals officially on\nthe staff of an International Organization (IO) and performing the functions of\nthat organization, or Voice of America correspondents on official assignment.  With\nthese exceptions, the COM is in charge of all executive branch personnel,\nactivities, and operations in his or her country of assignment (or area of\nresponsibility).\n    \n \n    b. The COM is responsible for the security of his or\nher Mission and, subject to the same exceptions noted above and an additional\nexception for any personnel for whom the Secretary of State has delegated\noperational control of overseas security functions to the head of such\npersonnel's parent agency (see\n    \n     2 FAH-2 H-116)\n    \n    , all U.S. Government personnel on\nofficial duty abroad and their authorized accompanying dependents.  The\nPresident's Letter of Instruction to Chiefs of Mission is the legal authority establishing\nCOM security responsibility.  This is a separate and distinct responsibility\nfrom COM authority.\n    \n \n    c.  COM authority and security responsibility are\nsubject to exceptions and exclusions by U.S. law or Presidential directive.  The\ngeneral exceptions are cited above.  These exceptions will apply throughout\n    \n     1 FAM 013.2\n    \n    , unless otherwise stated.\n    \n \n    d. Exclusions relate to personnel who are outside the\nboundaries of the qualifying language.  For example, the President's Letter of\nInstruction specifies that the COM's authority extends to all executive branch\npersonnel.  The use of the word \"personnel\" is meant to exclude those\nwho do not have a direct employer-employee relationship with the U.S.\nGovernment, e.g., Independent Contractors.\n    \n \n    e. The President’s Letter of Instruction is a\nfoundational document that explicitly addresses the authority and\nresponsibility of the COM and outlines the roles and responsibilities of\nexecutive branch agencies conducting official U.S. Government activities in the\nCOM’s country of responsibility.  The President instructs the COM to:\n    \n \n    (1)  Direct, coordinate, and supervise all U.S.\nGovernment executive branch activities, operations, and personnel;\n    \n \n    (2)  Take full responsibility for the security of the\nmission and all the personnel for whom the COM is responsible, regardless of\nlocation.  With the exceptions listed in section (a) and (b), the COM must\nprovide for the security of all U.S. Government personnel on official duty\nabroad and their authorized accompanying dependents; and\n    \n \n    (3)  Continually consult and coordinate with the GCC to\nkeep each other fully and currently informed, and to routinely coordinate on\nall activities of mutual interest.\n    \n \n    f.  The President's Letter additionally requires all\nU.S. Government personnel other than those under the command of a GCC to obtain\ncountry clearance before entering the COM's assigned country (or area of\nresponsibility) on official business. The COM may refuse country clearance or\nmay place conditions or restrictions on visiting personnel as deemed necessary.\n    \n \n    g.

Bureaus and some other specified Department\norganizations, usually headed by Assistant Secretaries or positions\nadministratively equivalent to the rank of Assistant Secretary, administer one\nor more major functions of the Department:\n    \n \n    (1)  If the bureau has more than one major function and\nis an organization of substantial size and or complexity, it should be further\nstructured to have deputy assistant secretaries (DASs), or positions ranked\nequivalent thereto, to oversee these major functions.  Where the size and scope\nof a major function requires it, a managing director may oversee collections of\noffice-level sub-functions.  A managing director is never equivalent to deputy\nassistant secretary rank.  Managing directors only report directly to deputy\nassistant secretaries, and directorate structure is such that managing\ndirectors are to have clearly defined managerial responsibilities (they are not\ndeputies to deputy assistant secretaries).\n    \n \n    (2)  Assistant Secretaries and equivalents report\norganizationally to their respective Under Secretary.  All Assistant\nSecretaries and equivalents have the right to direct access to the Secretary of\nState should circumstances arise where the Assistant Secretary believes it is\nurgent and direct access is required.  Assistant Secretaries should communicate\nwith the Secretary on non-urgent matters via Notes, Information Memos, etc.\n    \n \n    c.  Offices are structures below the DASs and are\nconstructed around sub-functions that require application of discrete bodies of\nknowledge and the exercise of policy control within that field.  These\nstructures usually are responsible for a complete functional field and are\nstaffed with professionals or specialists who are considered to be authorities\nin this field.\n    \n \n    d. Within the office structure there may be divisions\nthat are tasked with performing contiguous processes or perform staff or\noperating activities or carry out major sub-elements of the general functional\nfield.\n    \n \n    e. Branches and sections are further subdivisions of\nthe responsibilities assigned to a division.\n    \n \n    f.  Staff (as an organizational unit) is a structure\nconsisting of a minimum of six persons assigned to another organizational unit\nat any level.  Staff functions are generally discrete and self-contained.  A\nstaff may or may not have its own chief.\n   ",

         "\n    a. For the reasons noted in\n    \n     1 FAM 014.5\n    \n    , paragraph a,\norganizational layering is to be kept to a minimum.  If an organization does\nestablish a substructure, that substructure must comprise at least two\nsubcomponents (e.g., no bureau may have just one office-level subcomponent; no\noffice may have just one division level subcomponent, etc.).  Routine functions\n(such as certain administrative activities) may be further subdivided into\nbranch and section levels.  See\n    \n     1 FAM 014.4\n    \n\n\n    for\nan explanation of the organizational structure layers and nomenclature.  A\nDeputy Assistant Secretary (DAS) is an organizational head, which has no\nnomenclature for its level, even though there can be multiple directorates or\noffices reporting to the DAS.\n    \n \n    b. Regional bureaus may be organized on sub regional,\nmultiple country, and/or individual country bases.  This structure is designed\nto be flexible and contemplates the regrouping of countries whenever workload,\ncrises, or other operational matters dictate.  These organizational components\nare equivalent to an office.\n    \n \n    c.  Organizational structures involving full deputy or\nassistant positions are to be minimized and are reserved for situations where\nthe volume and nature of the principal’s work cannot be effectively\naccomplished by one person.  In particular:\n    \n \n    (1)  A deputy or assistant is expected to participate\nwith the principal in carrying out the full range of management\nresponsibilities, and to act with full authority over the total work of the\norganization during the principal’s unavailability or absence.  Where the\nsupervision of an office needs to be subdivided, the appropriate subcomponents\nare divisions led by division chiefs.  The use of specialized deputies (usually\nmultiple in numbers) to oversee specific aspects of the organization (e.g.,\nDeputy for Policy or Deputy for Operations) is considered an exception to this\npolicy and will rarely be justified;\n    \n \n    (2)  Deputy positions may not be authorized with\nrespect to Under Secretaries, deputy assistant secretaries or equivalents,\nmanaging directors, division chiefs, branch chiefs, section chiefs, or staff\nchiefs; and\n    \n \n    (3)  The classification approval required for the\nestablishment of full deputy/assistant positions is vested in the director and\nthe appropriate HR Service Provider; all requests to classify full\ndeputy/assistant positions will be reviewed against criteria issued by\n    \n     GTM/OTA\n    \n    (use Form DS-3051, Checklist for\nRequesting Establishment of Deputy/Assistant Positions).\n    \n \n    d. To maintain effective and efficient span of control,\nthe following criteria will guide the design of the organizational structure:\n    \n \n    (1)  An office must have at least 12\nfull-time/part-time permanent positions;\n    \n \n    (2)  Any organizational entity or subcomponent (i.e.,\ndivision, branch, or section) requires a minimum of eight full-time/part-time\npermanent positions; except for staff units which require a minimum of six\nfull-time/part-time permanent positions;\n    \n \n    (3)  Subdividing an organization must result in the\nsmallest possible number of subcomponents consistent with the criteria listed\nherein and with the requirements of the organization’s functional\nmission; and\n    \n \n    (4)  If an office is subdivided, the total number of\nfull-time/part-time permanent positions in the office (including\ndivisions/branches/sections) must be at least 17, eight for two divisions plus\nthe office director.  If the organization drops below the appropriate number of\npositions for a period exceeding 6 months, consideration should be given to its\nabolishment and/or consolidation into some other existing unit.\n    \n \n    e. Because the Department’s fundamental\norganizational building block is the office, the following guidelines should be\nconsidered carefully in creating an office:\n    \n \n    (1)  Like functions should be grouped together in an\norganization;\n    \n \n    (2)  Integral policy or operational fields should not\nbe divided into separate offices; and\n    \n \n    (3)  The level and degree of policy and negotiating\nresponsibility exercised by the organization are important factors in\ndetermining the need for an office.\n   ",

When changes in an organization and/or program are\napproved, the responsible office (usually the Executive Director) must send a\nwritten request with the\n    \n     Office of Organization\nand Talent Analytics\n    \n\n     (GTM/OTA\n    \n    )\norganizational structure design approval and head of bureau approvals for the\nestablishment, change, or discontinuation of organizations to CGFS/FPRA/FP in\naccordance with\n    \n     4 FAH-1 H-117\n    \n\n\n    Code\nMaintenance.  The request must include the approvals, an updated bureau\norganization chart, and the draft update to the\n    \n     1 FAM functions\n    \n    and\nresponsibilities statements.  The request with documentation must be sent via\nSMART record e-mail.\n    \n \n    b. When establishing or changing an organization name,\nrelated organization symbol and/or code, the responsible office may suggest\norganization symbols and codes.  Bureaus can refer to their existing codes in\n    \n     4 FAH-1 H-420\n    \n\n\n    to see the structure and to\nreview all their codes for other potential changes, such as organizations that\nhave been discontinued.\n    \n \n    c.  CGFS/FPRA/FP will review the request and work with\nthe bureau to ensure titles, symbols, and codes meet the requirements and will\nassign new and revised titles, symbols, and codes as required and discontinue\nany codes no longer required.\n    \n \n    d. Bureaus must also choose a pay period in which they\nwant these changes to become effective.  The date they choose is generally\nbased upon the completion date of Form SF-50, Notification of Personnel Action,\nfor the employees that are affected when an organization code is established,\nchanged, or discontinued.  Bureaus will have approximately three pay periods to\ncomplete personnel actions and work with other systems to transfer staff from\ncodes being discontinued.  This information (effective dates) will be recorded\nin the MRD.\n    \n \n    e. After CGFS/FPRA/FP approves the request, it updates\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    and notifies the appropriate systems and CGFS personnel, the requesting\nbureau, other bureau personnel, as needed, and A/GIS/DIR that changes to the\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    have been made.  CGFS/FPRA/FP will also provide updates to\nIRM/OPS/SIO/EPI/DM to record changes in the MRD to reflect the new and revised\ntitles, symbols, and/or codes.  Application systems that require real-time\nnotifications of changes in titles, symbols, and/or codes may receive these updates\ndirectly from the MRD in the future.  CGFS/FPRA/FP will consolidate its updates\nto\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    and send them to A/GIS/DIR with a change transmittal for publication\non the Office of Directives Management intranet site.\n    \n \n    f.  Bureaus will use the CGFS/FPRA/FP\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    update to\nfinalize their\n    \n     1 FAM functions\n    \n    and responsibilities statements as soon as\npossible following the publication of the updated\n    \n     4 FAH-1\n    \n    .\n   ",

However, if LOC personnel will\nbe working from Mission workspace, the COM must verify there is available\noffice space that complies with applicable security standards and statutory\nrequirements.\n    \n \n \n \n    8.2. Pursuant to this agreement, LOC agrees to obtain COM\napproval through exchange of memorandum between the LOC and the COM before\nadding, changing, and abolishing positions at LOC offices abroad.\n    \n \n \n \n    8.3. The LOC will provide advance notice of any proposed\nincreases in levels of overseas staffing to COMs, and any disagreement between\nthe LOC and a COM on staffing increases will be directed back to the MOU\nOversight Committee (MOC) for resolution. If it cannot be resolved at the MOC\nlevel, it will be resolved jointly by the Principal Deputy Librarian of\nCongress and the Under Secretary of State for Management.\n    \n \n \n \n    8.4. LOC USDHs assigned to post remain Library of Congress\nemployees subject to the authorities of 2 U.S.C. Ch. 5, Library of Congress\nRegulations, and other authorities governing LOC employment. While the LOC\nretains authority over hiring and termination, the parties agree that LOC USDH\npersonnel who are members of a U.S. mission and subject to COM control over\ncertain terms and conditions of employment at post may have a dual employee\nrelationship for equal employment opportunity purposes.\n    \n \n \n \n    8.5. In any circumstance where the COM believes a LOC USDH\nemployee should be removed from post for security or conduct reasons, the\nmatter will be immediately referred to the MOC accompanied by written\njustification. The MOC will review the matter and make recommendations to the\nsignatories of this MOU on how to proceed.\n    \n \n \n \n    8.6. Pursuant to 5 CFR 430.204, each agency shall\nestablish agency-wide policies for performance management for its USDH\nemployees. As defined in 5 CFR 841.104, “agency” includes\nlegislative branch agencies, and therefore this responsibility applies to the\nLOC.  The LOC retains sole authority over performance matters involving LOC\nUSDHs. If LOC USDH performance impacts Mission operations, the COM will raise\nany such concerns to the MOC.\n    \n \n \n \n    8.7. Pursuant to the President’s Letter of\nInstruction, COMs should promote a culture of equal opportunity and ensure that\nany misconduct, including discrimination and harassment of any kind, and poor\nperformance are addressed appropriately.\n    \n \n \n \n    9. PERSONAL SERVICES / LOCALLY RECRUITED STAFF.  The\nDepartment of State will exercise the authority in 2 U.S.C. 143a\n    \n\n    on behalf of the LOC to hire locally recruited\nstaff to perform services in support of the LOC at posts abroad.

LOC personnel receiving ICASS services will be\nsubject to the same policies and regulations governing those services as\napplied to all other ICASS customer agencies.\n    \n \n \n \n    10.2.

The LOC will be a resident agency and serve on the\nWashington ICASS Executive Board (defined in\n    \n     6 FAH-5 H-012.1).\n    \n    LOC country\nrepresentatives serve as voting members of Post ICASS Councils and Post Budget\nCommittees (\n    \n     6 FAH-5 H-012.6\n    \n\n\n    and .7).\n    \n \n \n \n    10.4. Annually, ICASS and the LOC will execute at each\npost a Memorandum of Understanding to fund requested ICASS services.\n    \n \n \n \n    10.4.1. The parties agree that services associated with\nthe residential nature of the LOC at the Mission will be mandatory and will\ncontinue to be available so long as the LOC retains its country presence and\nsubject to changes regarding mandatory services as later adopted by the ICASS. \nMandatory services include those defined in\n    \n     6 FAH-5 H-341\n    \n    , and the LOC may\nobtain other services required under circumstances where an agency occupies\nspace on the embassy compound.\n    \n \n \n \n    11.
